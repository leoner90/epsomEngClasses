****NEW EMAIL**** Please only contact us by bakerjanice746@gmail.com<br />

We are coming back to face-to-face classes after a year of virtual classes.  I am so looking forward to actually meeting students again.   But it will be different with socially distanced seating and Covid rules strictly observed.  We provide a choice of learning environments to suit students who are focusing on their English language conversation and those who need to prepare for Cambridge exams including PET, FCE, CAE or IELTS.
<br />Classes are appropriate for au pairs, adult students and learners new to the UK, here on business or as visitors or refugees.

<br />Our small friendly classes are held at St Martinâ€™s Church Hall, Church Street, Epsom KT17 4PX .
